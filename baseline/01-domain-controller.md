| 🌐 Domain | `northbridge.local` |
| 💻 Host System | Ubuntu 26.04 |
| ⚙️ Host CPU | Intel Core i3 |
| 💾 Host RAM | 8 GB |
| 📦 Virtualization | VirtualBox |
| 🎯 Server Role | Domain Controller |                     |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1️⃣ Server Identity

The Windows Server instance was renamed to:

`SRV-DC01`

This server is used as the primary domain controller for the NorthBridge Active Directory environment.

### 2️⃣ 🌐 Network Configuration

The server was configured with a static IPv4 address and the required network settings.

The network configuration was established before validating the Active Directory environment to provide consistent connectivity and DNS services for the domain.

### 3️⃣ 🧩 Server Roles

The required Windows Server roles and services were configured to support the NorthBridge environment, including:

* 🔐 Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
* 🌐 DNS
* 📂 File and Storage Services

The server was subsequently configured to support the:

`northbridge.local`

Active Directory domain.

## ✅ Validation

The configuration was validated by confirming:

* ✅ The server is identified as `SRV-DC01`.
* ✅ The required network configuration is present.
* ✅ Active Directory Domain Services is available.
* ✅ DNS is available for the environment.
* ✅ The server provides the foundation for the `northbridge.local` domain.
* ✅ A Windows client was subsequently able to join the domain.

Client domain-join and authentication validation are documented separately in the baseline evidence.

## 💡 Key Takeaway

This configuration establishes the **server-side foundation** for the NorthBridge Active Directory environment.

It provides the infrastructure required for:

* 🔐 Centralized identity management
* 🌐 DNS-based domain services
* 👤 Domain authentication
* ⚙️ Group Policy
* 🔒 Access-control management
* 🔍 Subsequent troubleshooting and security scenarios
