# NorthBridge Enterprise Active Directory

## 📌 Project Overview

NorthBridge is a hands-on Windows Active Directory lab built to practice and demonstrate real-world **IT administration, identity and access management, troubleshooting, and security operations** skills.

The environment includes a Windows Server domain controller and a Windows client joined to the domain. The project starts with a known-good Active Directory baseline and then uses realistic support and security scenarios to demonstrate **investigation, troubleshooting, remediation, and validation**.

This repository documents **my own implementation, screenshots, findings, and troubleshooting work**.

## 🏗️ What I Built

### Active Directory Baseline

The baseline environment includes:

* Windows Server domain controller
* `northbridge.local` Active Directory domain
* DNS configuration
* Organizational Units
* Domain users
* Security groups
* Group memberships
* Group Policy
* Password policy
* Department file shares
* NTFS permissions
* Share permissions
* Windows client domain joining
* Domain authentication

The baseline acts as the **known-good environment** for the troubleshooting cases that follow.

## 🔎 Scenario-Based Troubleshooting

After establishing the baseline, I work through realistic IT and security scenarios.

Examples include:

* 📁 Finance folder access problems
* 🔐 Incorrect or missing permissions
* 👤 User account and access issues
* 🔑 Authentication problems
* ⚙️ Group Policy issues
* 🌐 DNS and domain connectivity problems
* 💻 Windows client troubleshooting
* 🛡️ Security investigations
* 🚨 Incident handling

Each case follows a simple investigation process:

```text
Problem
   ↓
Investigation
   ↓
Evidence Collection
   ↓
Root Cause
   ↓
Resolution
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Documentation
```

This demonstrates not only configuration skills, but also the ability to **investigate and resolve problems systematically**.

## 🤝 Collaboration

This is an **individual project with collaborative scenario work**.

Three participants — **[Mr. Hari Krishnan R K](https://github.com/harikrishnan-rk), [Mr. Manu P Nair](https://github.com/manunair16) and [Mr. Varun M Nair](https://github.com/varunmnair95)** — maintain their own independent lab environments and GitHub repositories.

The physical/lab environments are not shared. Collaboration takes place mainly during scenario-based cases through:

* Troubleshooting discussions
* Sharing investigation approaches
* Comparing findings
* Role-based case activities
* Problem-solving
* Technical communication

Each repository represents the individual's **own implementation, screenshots, findings, and documentation**.

---

## 📸 Evidence & Documentation

Screenshots and technical evidence are included throughout the repository to show the actual work performed.

Evidence covers areas such as:

* 🖥️ Server configuration
* 🌐 Network configuration
* 🏢 Active Directory
* 🌐 DNS
* 👥 Users and groups
* ⚙️ Group Policy
* 📂 File and folder permissions
* 💻 Client domain joining
* 🔍 Troubleshooting results

Screenshots are supported by short explanations describing:

**What was done → Why it was done → What the evidence shows → How it was validated**
